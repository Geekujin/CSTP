# CSTP EPA Toolkit 

This is my study kit for the CSTP EPA practicals. 
The file structure will contain materials to aid with the practical assessments. Information about the exercise requirements can be found in the Wiki.

### 💡 What it's for
I pulled this repo together to help me plan for the EPA, and is a combo of various bits of info I pulled together. 

It will include:
- links to software and websites referenced within the EPA documents.
- links to potentially useful data sets (as sourcing them is not specifically tested against in the assessments, and will vary by scenario).
- Quick reference guides for commandline tools such as nmap and Metasploit
- Useful commands for Packet Tracer.

### ❌ What it isn't
This isn't a 'quick win' resource to do the exam for you. It's merely an aid to learning, helping to reduce the time spent hunting for specific resources or information so the focus can be on completing the work and writing it up.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
The information gathered has been done so using official resources as source where possible. I take no responsibility for any missing or outdated information, as the official documentation may change at any time. 

Please raise an issue if you'd like a resource adding, or consider making a pull request 😊
