# Implement monitoring techniques

Assume you are a cybersecurity analyst working for a large organization that operates several critical systems and networks. Your goal is to identify any anomalies in the network traffic that could indicate a security breach or unauthorized access to the systems. To accomplish this, you will need to analyse the network traffic and use statistical techniques to identify any patterns or anomalies.

## Apply statistical techniques to large data sets. Identify vulnerabilities in big data architectures and deployment.

- Collect network traffic data from the network devices you designed above and save it in a file for analysis
- Use a network traffic analysis tool such as Wireshark to capture and analyse the network traffic in real-time

## Undertake ethical system reconnaissance and intelligence analysis.

- Import the network traffic data into a statistical analysis tool such as R or Python and perform data cleaning and pre-processing to remove any errors or inconsistencies.
- Use statistical techniques such as clustering analysis, classification analysis, and outlier detection to analyse the data and identify any anomalies in the network traffic.
- Visualize the data using charts, graphs, and other visualization tools to help you gain a better understanding of the data and communicate your findings.

## Undertake risk modelling, analysis, and trades.

- Use the insights gained from the data analysis to identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the organization's network security architecture.
- Perform a risk analysis to determine the likelihood and potential impact of each vulnerability and prioritize them based on their severity.
- Develop and implement a mitigation plan to address the vulnerabilities and improve the overall security and reliability of the organization's network security architecture.

## Undertake risk assessment to an external standard.

- Use a recognized cybersecurity risk assessment framework such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO/IEC 27001, or CIS Controls to evaluate the organization's IT infrastructure, systems, and policies against an external standard.
- Assess the risks associated with each asset and data identified in the information gathering stage and prioritize them based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.
- Identify the existing controls that are in place to mitigate the identified risks and evaluate their effectiveness.
- Identify any gaps in the organization's security posture and provide recommendations for improving the security controls.

## Apply a management system and develop an information security management plan.

- Develop a mitigation plan that includes recommendations for improving the organization's security posture, including controls to be implemented, processes to be improved, and policies to be developed or revised.
- Prioritize the recommendations based on their potential impact and feasibility of implementation.
- Develop an implementation plan that includes timelines, responsibilities, and resources required to implement the recommendations.

## Security monitoring, analysis, and intrusion detection. Recognise anomalies & behaviours.

## Manage intrusion response, including with 3rd parties.

- Develop an incident response plan that includes procedures for detecting, analysing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents
- Identify the roles and responsibilities of your team members and establish a communication protocol for reporting and responding to incidents.
- Define the criteria for escalating incidents to 3rd parties and establish communication channels with 3rd parties such as law enforcement agencies, security vendors, and other stakeholders.

## Produce a written justification for the approach taken (1000 +/-100 words written document)

Creation of the system must evidence your knowledge of:

- Information management, big data concepts, statistical techniques, database concepts and data quality.
- Structured and ethical intelligence analysis, methods, and techniques.
- Management of cyber risk, tools, and techniques.
- Quantitative and qualitative risk management theory & practice, role of risk stakeholders.
- Concepts and benefits of security management systems, governance & international standards.
- How to diagnose cause from observables. Application of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools & techniques.
- Cyber incident response, management, escalation, investigation & 3rd party involvement.
