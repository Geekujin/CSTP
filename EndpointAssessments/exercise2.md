# Implement secure testing routines on your system

## Analyse malware & identify its mechanisms.

- Go to the Any.run website and create an account if you don't already have one.
- Download a malware sample from a public repository (VirusShare).
- Upload the malware sample to Any.run and analyse the malware.
- Observe the behaviour of the malware in the interactive report. Use the behavioural analysis to determine the type and purpose of the malware.
- Based on the analysis, determine whether the malware poses a threat and what actions should be taken to mitigate that threat

## Discover, identify, and analyse threats, attack techniques, vulnerabilities, and mitigations.

- You have been hired by this company to conduct a threat analysis and develop a mitigation plan to protect their network from potential attacks. Describe and demonstrate the process involved in collecting intelligence on potential threats by monitoring social media platforms, dark web forums, and other sources of information to identify potential threats.
- Create a threat model that outlines specific threats that need to be addressed based on the intelligence gathered in step one.
- Conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify weaknesses in the web application system you developed in the previous task, including software vulnerabilities, configuration errors, and other issues that could be exploited by attackers.
- Simulate a real-world attack on the system to identify weaknesses in the system's defences.

## Develop an assurance strategy.

- Develop a risk assessment plan to determine the likelihood and potential impact of each threat
- Develop an assurance strategy that addresses each of the identified threats, vulnerabilities, and attack techniques. This should include specific actions to reduce the risk of each threat you have identified in the previous task.
- Describe how you will test the effectiveness of the controls that are put in place.
- Identify procedures for incident response in the event of a security breach.

## Organise testing & investigation work in accordance with legal & ethical requirements.

- In the above task you simulated an attack on the system. Review legal and ethical requirements for incident response required for this scenario, including data protection laws and regulations, privacy and confidentiality considerations, and relevant industry standards.
- Develop a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines the role of each team member and their responsibilities, procedures for collecting and analysing data, and measures for protecting privacy and confidentiality.
- **Configure Autopsy Software:** 
	- The first subtask is to configure the Autopsy software to suit the organization's requirements. This includes setting up the software to analyse the type of data affected in the security breach and ensure that the software is compliant with the organization's legal and ethical requirements.
- **Conduct Preliminary Investigation:** 
	- You should conduct a preliminary investigation to identify the scope of the security breach and determine what data has been affected. This involves using Autopsy software to collect and analyse data, and identify potential evidence.
- **Create a Case:** 
	- Once the initial investigation is complete, you should create a case in Autopsy software for the security breach. This involves inputting all relevant data into the software and establishing a timeline of events leading up to the breach.
- **Document the Investigation:** 
	- You should document all aspects of the investigation in Autopsy software, including data collection, analysis, and mitigation measures.

## Produce a written justification for the approach taken (1000 +/-100 words written document)

Creation of the system must evidence your knowledge of:
- Malware, reverse engineering, obfuscation.
- Threats, vulnerabilities, impacts and mitigations in ICT systems and the enterprise environment.
- Assurance concepts & approaches.
- Applicability of laws, regulations & ethical standards
