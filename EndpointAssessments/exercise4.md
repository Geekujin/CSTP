# Implement defensive programming

## Write, test, debug programs in high- and low-level languages and scripts.
- Here a focus could be on the debugging of your software application. Considering:
    - What are the best practices and techniques for debugging?
    - Explaining static analysis, dynamic analysis, and peer-reviewing of code. 
    - How do you prevent bugs in your code? How do you use compiler flags and static code checkers to identify bugs in an early stage of coding? 
    - Demonstrate debugging of a serial program using any debugging tools such as GDB and Valgrind to fix a serial program. 
    - Demonstrate debugging of a parallel program using any debugging tools such as Intel Inspector and ITAC to fix a parallel program 

## Design, implement and analyse algorithms.

- Showcase your understanding and critical analysis of defensive programming. Consider and/or showcase: 
    - Differentiating normal programming and defensive programming based on high availability, safety, and security. 
    - What you mean when using good coding styles, good documentation strategies and good code testing techniques in defensive programming? 
    - Provide a use case of defensive programming and explain why you think defensive programming is essential for your chosen use case. 
    - Explain various downsides of defensive programming. 

## Apply secure programming principles and design patterns to address security issues.

- Safety of a software application. Consider: 
    - What are strongly typed languages? Explain their benefits and limitations in defensive programming. 
    - Most programming languages are not perfect for defensive programming so what would be necessary protections or programming rules you will apply in your defensive coding? 
    - Illustrate an application of the following rules using a suitable programming example: rules for naming objects, rules for prohibiting certain constructions, rules exported by reused/pre-existing elements, and rules exported by execution platform. 
    - What are guard clauses and assertions? Explain both with a suitable example. 

## Apply system engineering and software development methodologies and models.

- Here, you could consider the security of your software application. Explore by: 
    - Differentiating defensive programming with offensive programming. 
    - Showing/describing how would you determine possible attack surfaces in your software? 
    - Showing/describing what are the necessary security rules or policies you will apply in your defensive coding? 
    - Why you should write your code as if it will be attacked and everything can fail. 
    - Why external dependencies are so crucial to ensure the security of your software and how would you prevent security threats in your defensive coding due to external dependencies. 

## Produce a written justification for the approach taken (1000 +/-100 words written document)

Creation of the system must evidence your knowledge of:

- Algorithm and program design concepts, compilers, and logic. Programming languages.
- Algorithms, complexity, and discrete maths
- Defensive programming, malware resistance, code analysis, formal methods, good practice.
- System development principles, tools, approaches, complexity, software engineering,
